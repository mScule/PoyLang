$Y**DATATYPES**$W

$MFloat$W
  
  Every number is treated as a float number.
  Float works by parsing string of text to C# float and treating it as such.

$MString$W

  String contains characters. MSCC only supports strings consisting of C# char datatype.
  String literals can be defined by surrounding the string with quotation marks " ... " or curly braces { ... }.
  By using curly braces you dont have to escape quotes inside strings,
  and by using quotation marks, you don't have to escape closing curly brace.

$MEscape characters$W

  Inside string literal, you can use \n, \t, \\, \}, and \" to use escape characters.
  \} and \" are special cases. You \} if string is contained inside curly braces,
  and \" if string is contained inside quotation marks. If you add \} inside string that is contained inside "",
  it will cause a unsupported escape character error and vice versa inside {} using \" will cause the same.
